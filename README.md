# üì¶ CICD Pipeline

A simple tool for build/test automation.

# Quick Start üöÄ

1. Create a directory called `repos` in your server. For the sake of convenience we recommend to do so in the `/opt/cicd` path:
```
cd /opt
mkdir -p cicd/repos
```
2. Go to the newly cretaed directory:
```
cd cicd/repos
```
3. Clone the repos you want to automate the building/testing process of:
```
git clone <https path to your repo>
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** CICD Pipeline doesn't wirk with `git` protocol at the time.

4. Run docker:
```
docker run --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /opt/cicd/repos:/opt/cicd/repos \
-e DOCKER_USER=<your docker login> \
-e DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your docker password> \
-it alekslitvinenk/cicd-pipeline
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** This configuration is tailored for building and publishing docker images to Docker Hub.<br>
For that reason it has some tweaks:
1. `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` - binds inner docker unxi socket to the outer one.
2. Sets two environment variables to run `docker login`.
3. `--privileged` flag is required since cicd-pipeline runs docker-in-docker configuration.
